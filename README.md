# Towers of Hanoi

Play the game Towers of Hanoi! This game uses Ruby and is played in the console.

## Instructions

1. Install ruby if you do not already have it.
2. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/RonKew28/Chess/archive/master.zip)
3. Unzip the zip file. In the terminal, navigate to the TowersofHanoi-master directory.
4. Type 'bundle install' in the console.
5. Type 'ruby towers_of_hanoi.rb' to start the game!

## How To Play

Learn more about the rules of Towers of Hanoi [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

In this game, the goal is to move all the disks from Tower 1
to one of the other towers. You must adhere to the following rules:
  1. You can only move one disk at a time.
  2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The disks are depicted as follows:

1. Smallest disk: ♟
2. Medium-sized disk: ♟♟♟
3. Largest disk: ♟♟♟♟♟

To play, first select which tower you would like to move the disk
from by typing '1', '2', or '3', and then pressing enter.

Then, select which tower you would like to move that disk to.

## Future Directions

Right now the game uses only 3 disks. I would like to refactor the code so that the player can choose how many disks are in the game.
